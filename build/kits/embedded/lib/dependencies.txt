If you are not using XQuery, there is no need to include "saxonhe-9.2.1.5.jar" jar file in the class path. All other files need 
to be included in your applications's classpath. Depending upon which sources you use with the Teiid embedded, you also need 
to add translators jar files from the optional directory.
