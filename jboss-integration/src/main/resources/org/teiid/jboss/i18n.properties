			 0 indicates use the default calculated value based on max active plans and max threads - approximately 2*(max threads)/(max active plans). \  
			 1 forces serial execution in the processing thread, just as is done for a transactional request.  \
			 Any number greater than 1 limits the maximum number of concurrently executing source requests accordingly.

type.describe=Allowed values are LRU, EXPIRATION. \  
             Setting this value to LRU will cause cache hint TTL values \
             to be ignored. (default EXPIRATION)
location.describe=location
	
#cache-factory
cache-service-jndi-name.describe=cache service for the distributed cache
resultsetCacheName.describe=resultset cache node name
