   <title>Clustering in Teiid</title>
   <para>Since Teiid is installed in JBoss AS, there is no separate configuration needed on the part of the user to cluster 
   the Teiid instances. Check the <link linkend="installation">installation</link> for quick instructions. See 
   detailed JBoss AS <ulink url="https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/AS7/Documentation">instructions</ulink> here. 
   Just make sure that you installed Teiid in every JBoss AS node and started JBoss AS instances in the 
   Domain mode before starting the cluster.

        Typically users create clusters to improve the performance of the system through:  
        <orderedlist>
            <listitem> <para>Load Balancing: Take look at the Client developers guide on how to use load balancing between multiple nodes.</para> </listitem>
            <listitem> <para>Fail Over: Take look at the Client developers guide on how to use fail over between multiple nodes.</para> </listitem>
            <listitem> <para>Distributed Caching: This is automatically done for you once you configure it as specified above. </para> </listitem>
            <listitem> <para>Event distribution: metadata and data modifications will be distributed to all cluster members. </para> </listitem>
        </orderedlist>          
   </para>   
   
   <para>In the domain mode, the only way user can deploy any artifacts is using either CLI or using the Admin API or Admin Shell. 
   Copying VDB directly into the "deployments" directory is not supported. </para>
